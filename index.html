                    <p class="card-text"><span style="color: #2DC6E0" ;>BOSTON (20 Oct 2021)</span> – Air Combat
                      Command and Kessel Run signed a user agreement Sept. 30, outlining the details of how the
                      software development and acquisitions unit will operationally support the major command.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">This is the first user agreement signed between a Major Air Force Command
                      and a software factory under DoDI 5000.87 Operation Of The Software Acquisition Pathway. Its
                      signing showcases the advances that have been made by Kessel Run toward modernizing the Air
                      Operation Center (AOC) Weapon System. The User Agreement formalizes the existing
                      relationship between ACC and Kessel Run.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“We now have the foundation for pushing out war-winning capability to
                      joint force commanders at the speed of need,” said Jacquelynn Torson, the test and
                      integration chief with Kessel Run. “We published a memo called the ‘Guardianship Model’ in
                      November of last year, the User Agreement is an iteration on that. It enhances our
                      relationship with ACC because it provides our commitment to them. We will be including them
                      in every step of the way to deliver the operational capabilities they need and want.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The United States Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Detachment 12,
                      also known as Kessel Run, has a proven track record in enhancing efficiency, saving cost and
                      modernizing the way the Air Force operates with its agile software development. With its
                      user-centered approach to development, Kessel Run’s mission is to rapidly deliver combat
                      capabilities to warfighters and revolutionize the Air Force software acquisition process.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text">“We have an ever-evolving, battle tested and proven method for delivering
                      operational capabilities through our applications,” said Col. Brian Beachkofski, commander
                      of Kessel Run. “Kessel Run’s applications are operational, and this user agreement outlines
                      how we will enhance ACC with these capabilities.”</p>

            <p>The future that Kessel Run software is creating is one where we match targets to available assets
              dynamically, much like Uber matches riders to drivers. To be successful, the Air Force also needs to
              maximize asset availability, which means having great maintenance and pilot readiness tools. These
              applications need to be available in the right classification to the right people at the right time.
              That’s possible through Kessel Run’s infrastructure and platform capabilities.</p>

                    <p style="color: #2DC6E0;">Press Release</p>
                    <hr class=" newsline1">

                    <p class="card-text"><span style="color: #2DC6E0" ;>BOSTON (13 Oct 2021)</span> – Kessel Run
                      recently partnered with Headquarters, Supreme Allied Command Transformation (HQ SACT) to
                      deliver a software application, used to plan air-to-air refueling (AAR) operations, to two
                      NATO units as part of a foreign military sale (FMS) earlier this year.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The United States Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Detachment 12,
                      also known as Kessel Run, developed JIGSAW; the tanker fuel planning application in use
                      since 2017. It has helped save the DoD more than $500 million dollars in fuel costs and
                      greatly reduced the time associated with planning refueling missions, enhancing combat
                      capabilities through its increased coordination.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">With the stewardship HQ SACT, JIGSAW was successfully deployed for
                      evaluation at two NATO units: at the Deployable Air Command and Control Centre (DACCC), in
                      Poggio-Renatico, Italy, Sept. 9-14, during an independent NATO exercise; and at the Combined
                      Air Operations Centre (CAOC) South in Torrejon, Spain, Sept. 15-16, during the Torrejon
                      Advantage Drill (TAD).</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“By engaging in this strategic partnership with Kessel Run - we have been
                      able to acquire the licence for JIGSAW, which has allowed NATO to experiment with that
                      software,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Clow, the NATO FMS Officer for JIGSAW with the Royal
                      Canadian Air Force’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation Headquarters. “The purpose of
                      this is two-fold: to build a strategic relationship with Det 12, in order to help inform and
                      advise the creation of an organic software development at HQ SACT, as well as to experiment
                      and accelerate requirement and capability development on this particular need, which is
                      air-to-air refueling planning.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Clow said the exercises gave the NATO units the ability to thoroughly
                      test the application; the results of which were its immediate implementation as the primary
                      means to execute refueling missions.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“Compared to the legacy method, the actual planning time to generate a
                      plan is 800% faster and overall the process requires half the people, for half the time,”
                      Clow said. “When the user says ‘I trust this. This works the way I think about doing this
                      task and I don't need to use that legacy method anymore,’ that is the ultimate datapoint -
                      the user.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Kessel Run has a proven track record in enhancing efficiency, saving cost
                      and modernizing the way the Air Force operates with its agile software development. With its
                      user-centered approach to development, Kessel Run’s mission is to rapidly deliver combat
                      capabilities to warfighters and revolutionize the Air Force software acquisition process.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text">“We are preparing our allies for tomorrow's fights today by providing
                      them with software solutions that warfighters love,” said Col. Brian Beachkofski, commander
                      of Kessel Run. “Kessel Run’s applications are operational, and our allies are getting to
                      experience that first hand.”</p>

                    <p style="color: #2DC6E0;">Press Release</p>
                    <hr class=" newsline1">

                    <p class="card-text"><span style="color: #2DC6E0" ;>BOSTON (28 September 2021)</span> – Kessel
                      Run’s Slapshot application was recently used in what is being said is the largest
                      non-combatant evacuation in history by U.S. and coalition forces, with a total of 122,300
                      people airlifted from Kabul, Afghanistan.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The operation went from the end of July to Aug. 30, according to State
                      Department estimates. Due to increasing threats by the Taliban and increased pressure to
                      pull-out all military forces in the area; the Department of Defense’s priority was to get
                      American citizens, Afghans with special immigrant visa applications, and other vulnerable
                      Afghans out of the country. Military aircraft, mainly C-17 Globemaster IIIs, were leaving
                      every 45 minutes from the Hamid Karzai International Airport.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">When U.S. Air Forces Central and the Department of Defense expressed this
                      dire situation to Kessel Run; they were ready to answer the call.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“AFCENT Airmen, alongside AMC, coalition, and joint partners, applied
                      incredibly innovative solutions to complex problem-sets in order to airlift tens of
                      thousands of Americans and U.S. personnel, allies and partners and Afghans at special risk
                      from Kabul, up to and including the joint tactical exfiltration of ground troops,” said Lt.
                      Gen. Greg Guillot, Ninth Air Force (AFCENT) commander. “Kessel Run’s programmers more than
                      kept pace, rapidly iterating critical applications like Slapshot in order to meet the
                      evolving needs of leaders, planners, and operators across the world in real-time.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Slapshot, a mission and air-combat sortie flow organizer, was designed by
                      software engineers at Kessel Run, officially known as Air Force Life Cycle Management Center
                      Detachment 12. The software was developed as a replacement to enter or pull data and perform
                      quality checks that were normally manually performed by weapon system operators, or even
                      pilots themselves in the field. This information is compiled to develop the Master Air
                      Attack Plan, and visualizes the pairing of air combat missions with a respective air tasking
                      order (ATO).</p>

                    <p class="card-text">In regards to what it takes just to get aircraft safely off the ground
                      and into crowded airspace, that’s no simple task. Before Slapshot, operators or pilots used
                      excel documents or visualizations similar to a gantt chart. Today, the application features
                      tasks in real-time, individual tasks that support the commander's intent, and then assets
                      carrying out each task.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“During the evacuation in Afghanistan, it’s been mostly used as a very,
                      very effective tool for situational awareness,” said Gabriel Stines, a software engineer
                      with Kessel Run that works on Slapshot.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Stines added that it was used around the clock in operations, as well as
                      to brief different American and coalition commanders, air traffic controllers and even the
                      Secretary of Defense and President of the United States.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“We’ve seen truly record use of Slapshot,” said Stines. “Up until (the
                      beginning of the evacuation), we hadn’t had this many people use the platform.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Naturally, when software is used at this scale, there are bound to be
                      bugs or difficulty with scaling its capabilities. Stines said that due to how Slapshot was
                      built and having liaison officers to relay life saving information on the ground in
                      Afghanistan, software engineers here back home at Kessel Run were able to field and fix
                      issues in real-time.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">On August 23rd - only nine days after the Taliban unexpectedly seized the
                      capital - more than 21,000 people were evacuated in what was also the largest <i>single
                        day</i> airlift in history.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Stines said that there was a brief outage on that day, due to Slapshot
                      accommodating anywhere from 20 to 200 missions. After fixing the outage, which would cause
                      the application’s user interface to take 3-6 minutes to load, he and other members of the
                      Kessel Run team cut those times down to around 3 seconds, saving precious time, resources
                      and lives.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Slapshot was also being used for passenger manifest, he said, which
                      involved arguably the most difficult part of the evacuation - the logistics.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“We had all these people who needed food, visas and housing, and we
                      needed to know what to do with them after landing at their destination,” Stines said.
                      “Slapshot helped with that situational awareness and met the needs of the coalition effort.
                      Having our (liaison officers) fielding issues and being able to iterate on the system
                      parallel with us, and on the same day fixing problems completely… that just doesn't happen
                      anywhere else.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Stines said that they were able to dry-run the changes they were making
                      in a sort of digital staging area, while liaison officers - with literally the
                      boots-on-the-ground, in some cases - could communicate with end users to fully realize their
                      immediate needs. Using DevSecOps and other internal, agile processes, Kessel Run could test,
                      iterate and deliver Slapshot’s multitenant features at the stakeholders discretion.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Josh Pritchett, product lead at Kessel Run and liaison officer with the
                      609th U.S. Air Force Air Operations Center, said that from initial contact to solution
                      delivery, he was involved the entire time acting as a customer representative to ensure
                      mission success.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Pritchett added that he also helped explain the software, and translate
                      jargon and technical terms so as to make sure all parties understood what was being said and
                      done at all times.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“It was a customer solutions opportunity,” Said Pritchett. “That’s
                      basically the role (liaison officers) play, and I do think we were integral in the
                      operation's success. I had to communicate the urgency between the two parties.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">He added that, traditionally, normal acquisitions require a six to eight
                      month iteration cycle for a new update to software.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“At Kessel Run, we can make updates or create changes at will,” said
                      Pritchett. “As long as we understand the need, we can deliver on a solution that hits the
                      mark for users. The difference is that a lot of traditional acquisitions is that a lot of
                      the requirements were generated from outside of the (Air Operations Command) or user base.
                      With C2IMERA and Slapshot, we’re sitting down with real people using the software to perform
                      an operational need. We were able to deliver a series of solutions that created a near-term
                      and lasting impact within a very short timeframe.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Pritchett said that LNOs add an empathetic, hands-on approach to fixing
                      solutions for the end users. Within hours, he and his contacts ended up fielding a fixing
                      solution that they were able to implement the very next day.</p>
